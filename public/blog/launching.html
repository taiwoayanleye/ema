City, State Zip Code
Date of Writing
Name of Person
Title of Person

your letter to. If that’s not available, use
“Dear [name of company] representative,”
Dear Mr. / Ms. / Dr. Last Name:
Describe why you are writing: Include the position, field, or area to which you’re applying and tell
how you learned of the opening. Include a brief statement about what is unique about your skills
or experiences that would make you a good fit in the organization and the field. Also, offer a
brief statement demonstrating specific knowledge of the company to which you are applying.
Tailor this to each employer to demonstrate your interest and that you’ve done your homework.
Use this paragraph to demonstrate to the employer how your interests, education, and
experience fit the requirements described in the position posting. Describe the qualifications that
you think are most relevant. If you have related experience or specialized training, or
specialized training, briefly mention it here. Think about all the transferrable skills you have
gained in various jobs, volunteer experiences, campus activities, and research. Briefly
summarize how those experiences are relevant to the position.
Refer the employer to your resume for further details about your experiences and qualifications.
Reiterate why you want to work at that specific company. Offer your contact information and
thank the employer for their time and consideration. If appropriate, indicate when and how you
plan on following up on the submission of your cover letter.
Sincerely,
Name

as a paper copy, sign above your
typed name.
Enc. (If you enclose a resume or other materials)
Keep your cover letter to 1 page.
Remember, this is to entice the
employer to read through your
resume, so it does not need to
include every single detail!</p>
